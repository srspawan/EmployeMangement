Employee Management is the sample project to manage Employee Details using H2 Database. 

We need to include the below dependency of need to select the H2 support while creating the Spring project from initializer.

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
	<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
	<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

We have to add the below property in the application.properties file to enable the H2-Console.
  spring.h2.console.enabled=true

So you can access the h2-console with the below url after your application started successfully.
  http://<host>:<port>/h2-console
  
Database Queries to create table:
CREATE TABLE employee(id int primary key,name varchar(50),dep varchar(100));

You have to configure the H2 Database properties in application.properties to get connection with database. 
Here are the list of properties which I have placed to created Hibernate SessionFactory.


I have used the JpaRepository to interact with the Database and using predefined methods in JpaRepository.
